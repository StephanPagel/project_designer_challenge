                <p>
                    Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                    attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
                    paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more
                    sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
                    interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and
                    did not solve any problem.

                    <h3><img src="assets/img/title02.svg" alt="icon bulb">Start with asking why</h3>
                    <p>
                        You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more effective ways of achieving
                        goals.

                    <p>
                        By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will be fresher and more
                        valuable.

                    <p>
                        Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and
                        resolve to end it.
                    </p>

                    <h3> <img src="assets/img/title03.svg" alt="icon pen"> Share and show your work</h3>
                    <p>
                        As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect.
                        You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
                    </p>

            </article>
            <h2>Are you ready? Let’s go!!</h2>
            <p>
                The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to create a solution to any problem you
                yourself are facing and show the result to the community.

                        It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys,
                        calling
                        a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close
                        attention to your surroundings.
